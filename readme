ArduPowerStrip
==============

NOTE: After getting a mega 2560 I found this program uses atleast 2.6k of memory. The uno only has 2k. Hopefully I will fix this in the future....

This was developed on a Arduino Uno board, an R3 ethernet sheild, and the 1.0.x branch of the Arduino IDE.


All interactions are done through telnet. Some debugging output is given through the serial port (8N1 9600) such as the ip, etc. It does not take input from serial at this time. 

A section with user settings should be changed to fit your needs before flashing.

statusLED (user specified) is a pin that should be attached to a led on the chassis of the power strip. The led will turn on when the device is ready and blink when there is an active telnet session. You could also attach the pin to a relay to switch the main circuit for your office or data center lighting to blink the lights whenever someone is using the power strip ;-)


Here is some of the output from a telnet session:
